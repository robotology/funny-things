### Description
The **iCubBlinker** is a module developed by *Ugo Pattacini*; it is aimed at providing an easy to use interface for the blinking of the iCub. It makes the robot randomly blink with a period defined by [a random number with uniform distribution](http://wiki.icub.org/yarpdoc/classyarp_1_1math_1_1Rand.html#a0a55882615bb43b8a0a73827631090aa) in the range `[min_dt, max_dt]` (default `[3.0 10.0]`). Furthermore, one of `5` blinks is always a double blink.

### Input Arguments
* `--name [iCubBlinker]` changes the name of the module. Every port name will be changed accordingly.
* `--robot [icub]`       defines which robot the module will interface with (either `icub` or `iCubSim`).
* `--min_dt [3.0]`       defines the lower bound of the period generated by the random number generator.
* `--max_dt [10.0]`      defines the upper bound of the period generated by the random number generator.
* `--autoStart`          specifies if the module has to run automatically or not. By default, the `iCubBlinker` does not run on its own: the user has to specify this flag in order to make it run.

### Input Ports
* `/iCubBlinker/emotions/raw`: it is automatically connected to `/+robot+/face/raw/in`
* `/iCubBlinker/rpc` it is an interface for handling the blinking. It accepts the following commands:
  * `start` start the module
  * `stop` stop the module
  * `get` get the module status (either `on` or `off`)
  * `blink` do a single blink
  * `dblink` do a double blink
